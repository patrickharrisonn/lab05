# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_


bars not very helpful as size not representative of no. values


## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

No numbers so not easy to get proper values, different sizes of sections not helpful.


## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

overlappting points makes hard to read, 
clearly displays a trend


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_


clearly displayed data


# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

wide dqta every data point is a new column, leading to a column heavy layout

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

wide

How many observations are there in the data set?

55


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff%>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(faculty_type), 
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )
staff_long
```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(y = Year, 
                     x = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()


```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(Year = as.double(Year))
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(as=FALSE)

```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here


staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(Year = as.double(Year))
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title="Graph to show change of percentage faculty type with year.")



```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Change non relevant lines to b+w
* 
* 
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here
view(staff_long)

custom_colours <- c(
  "Full-Time Tenured Faculty"="black",
  "	Full-Time Tenure-Track Faculty"="gray50",
  "Full-Time Non-Tenure-Track Faculty"="gray80",
  "Graduate Student Employees"="gray90",
  "Part-Time Faculty"="firebrick")
  
  
staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(Year = as.double(Year))
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title="Graph to show change of percentage faculty type with year.")+
  scale_colour_manual(values=custom_colours)

```
